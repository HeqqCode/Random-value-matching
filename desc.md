	Value Matching program

<h2> {Extended Description}</h2>

##This is a program to test raw computing power. Please refer to the description for the most basic details
###SIGNED/UNSIGNED MODE
#signed:
	Signed mode is generally easier to run as it includes only positive integers. For example, if the 
	value you have given is 20, it will be 20*10000 (200000), so i can be anywhere from 0 to 2000000
	The goal of the program is to match that with another random integer within that same range
#unsigned:
	Exactly the same as signed except you now get the extent variable that includes negative numbers too.
	Use this if you trust your computer not to blow up.
